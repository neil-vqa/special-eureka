excerpt: '"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she.
  "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came
  in by the first train to **Waterloo**. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer;
  I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one,
  who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of
  you, Mr. Holmes'

"Whatever your reasons may be, you are perfectly correct," said she. "I started from home before six, reached Leatherhead at twenty past, and came in by the first train to **Waterloo**. Sir, I can stand this strain no longer; I shall go mad if it continues. I have no one to turn to--none, save only one, who cares for me, and he, poor fellow, can be of little aid. I have heard of you, Mr. Holmes; I have heard of you from Mrs. Macintosh, whom you helped in the hour of her sore need. It was from her that I had your address. 

> Oh, sir, do you not think that you could help me, too, and at least throw a little light through the dense darkness which surrounds me? 

At present it is out of my power to reward you for your services, but in a month or six weeks I shall be married, with the control of my own income, and then at least you shall not find me ungrateful."

I had no keener pleasure than in following **Holmes** in his professional investigations, and in admiring the rapid deductions, as swift as intuitions, and yet always founded on a logical basis with which he unravelled the problems which were submitted to him. I rapidly threw on my clothes and was ready in a few minutes to accompany my friend down to the sitting-room. A lady dressed in black and heavily veiled, who had been sitting in the window, rose as we entered.
